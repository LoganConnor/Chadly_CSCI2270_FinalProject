# Chadly_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
 This program is intended to allow for hash function effectiveness comparison for a given set of string type data. After running the driver file, the user will be presented with a menu interface. Options will include setting the size of the hash table to be tested (choosing this option will delete the current hash table and form a new hash table, using the currently selected hash function, of the new size), reading in a text file through cin input, inserting an additional string (this will also output whether or not the string encountered a collision and the new depth of the collision position), deleting a string, comparing all included hash functions (outputting the number of collisions found after hashing for each function; option can only be selected after setting the table size and adding strings to be hashed), an option to choose a hash function for in depth analysis, an option to check the maximum depth of the currently selected hash table, an option to create histogram data of the number of positions of a given depth versus depth, an option to display information on all included hash functions, an option to reset the current string data, and an option to quit the program.
